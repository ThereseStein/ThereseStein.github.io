          We want to take a look at the time-serie of the number of reports for each of our focus crimes. The following plot lets us focus on tighter time intervals, which lets us see activities that are hidden when only looking at the yearly summaries. Feel free to interact with the scroll-bar to travel through the time.

          Throughout all periods, the incidence of stolen properties remains consistently low. However, robbery, burglary, and vehicle theft were more prevalent until 2006, after which there was a significant decrease in reported cases of these crimes. In contrast, the number of larceny/theft reports fluctuated throughout the entire period, with peaks and troughs observed. Notably, multiple outliers are evident, indicating dates with abnormal activities. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify"> 
          For instance, an outlier in June 2017 shows approximately 50 more larceny-related crimes, while an outlier from December 2015 shows 50 fewer reports than expected for that period. These outliers may stem from special occasions such as elections, tax seasons, raids, or other events that impact the criminal system.

          The plot does not directly indicate a significant correlation between Larceny/theft and the other crime type.

          We have now discovered some interesting trends among the stealing crimes. Stealing tends to happen closer to the city center, different types of stealing have different behavior - also throughout the years, and some single days have an unusual amount of larceny-type theft.

          In summary, there are many patterns to discover, but truly understanding the cause of each will require more expert knowledge.
